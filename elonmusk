@Neuro_Skeptic Some quarks &amp; a lepton walk into a bar ‚Ä¶
@eamokeane Things get weird at the driver level
@WholeMarsBlog That‚Äôs where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).  Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs &amp; mid range cars.
@teslaownersSV We went public for $3.40/share!
@PPathole @SpaceX Science-fiction should not be fiction forever!
@ErcXspace @austinbarnard45 @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight Might take a few kicks at the can before we catch the rocket haha
@p_ferragu Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it.   Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder ‚Äì like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.  That said, it‚Äôs obv not a long-term issue.
@Teslarati @Writer_01001101 Sigh

@itsALLrisky Sounds kinda fun
@ValaAfshar OG Smartwatch
@WorldofTesla1 Yeah, new Model S &amp; X have PS5 level entertainment computing power
@DocumentingBTC Nice
@jeremyjudkins @Ryanth3nerd @Tesla Agreed
@Model3Owners Making this work has been / still is super difficult, but it‚Äôs a revolution in car body design &amp; production ‚Äì lighter, tighter, better NVH, higher precision, lower capex, lower unit cost
@Ryanth3nerd @Tesla Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used.  Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially.
@ErcXspace @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight @MarcusHouse Pretty close. Inner ring is closer to center 3, as all 12 gimbal together. Boost back burn efficiency is greatly improved in this config.

@SHillforVegas @boringcompany @LVCVA Vegas FTW!
@skorusARK Exactly. Atmospheric drag clearing out orbital debris is a major reason why we dropped altitude to ~550km.

@AlexSvanArt @Neopork85 Pretty close. No tiles on back side of flaps. Some tiles towards leeward side of ship trailing plasma spilling off rear of flaps.
@SciGuySpace Cumulative payload to orbit is the really crazy number. Falcon has delivered more than double rest of world combined over trailing 12 months.

@Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 Yup
@Astro_Elliott @Teslarati @ResidentSponge Aiming to have hot gas thrusters on booster for first orbital flight
@IlyaRosenberg @Caspar_Stanley @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX @SuperHeavyBN3 They are now the same (LOX below CH4). Ox is 3.5 times heavier than fuel, so makes sense to have it lower.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge Pure vision Autopilot is now rolling out in North America. There will be an update of this production release in 2 weeks, then FSD beta V9.0 (also pure vision) a week later. FSD subscription will be enabled around the same time.

Someone suggested changing Dogecoin fees based on phases of the moon, which is pretty awesome haha
Spoke with North American Bitcoin miners. They committed to publish current &amp; planned renewable usage &amp; to ask miners WW to do so. Potentially promising.
@SpaceNews_Inc Congrats! @virgingalactic
@flcnhvy @thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Becoming multiplanetary is one of the greatest filters. Only now, 4.5 billion years after Earth formed, is it possible.   How long this window to reach Mars remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not.   In case it is the latter, we should act now.
@PPathole @SpaceX The hard part about Raptor is simplifying it
@TheRealShifo The true battle is between fiat &amp; crypto. On balance, I support the latter.
Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology
@RocketRundown Welcome to the future. It‚Äôs gonna be great.
@jimfarley98 Congrats!

@teslaownersSV This will actually be able to fly very briefly. I always laughed at flying cars &amp; now making one. Fate üñ§ irony haha.
@AstroJordy @Tesla We can‚Äôt wait to build this crazy truck! It‚Äôs a total rethink of vehicle mechanical architecture &amp; production methods, so super hard project, but worthwhile in the end.
@BTCsessions @TeslaGong @wintonARK Achieving truly decentralized finance ‚Äì power to the people ‚Äì is a noble &amp; important goal.   Layer count depends on projected bandwidth &amp; compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network can carry all human transactions in future imo.  For now, Lightning is needed.
@TeslaGong @wintonARK Ideally 0.1kWh, calculated as total energy used by system divided by max transaction rate
@BLKMDL3 @TeslaGong @wintonARK Yes, with the SpaceX rocket thruster option package. It will be safe, but very intense. Probably not wise for those with a medical condition ‚Äì same as a hardcore roller coaster.
@TeslaGong @wintonARK Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale.
@wintonARK I agree that this *can* be done over time, but recent extreme energy usage growth could not possibly have been done so fast with renewables.  This question is easily resolved if the top 10 hashing orgs just post audited numbers of renewable energy vs not.

@flcnhvy @MarcusHouse Oh sorry, yes, Roadster will have thrusters, not Plaid. Plaid is indeed close to the theoretical maximum of a roadworthy car without special devices.
@MarcusHouse It will have high pressure air rocket thrusters behind a license plate that flips down. Bong, James Bong ‚Ä¶
@austinbarnard45 Good idea
@austinbarnard45 Sure
@thatdogegirl @WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Worth reading
@WhatsupFranks @TeslaGong Currency is already digital! Decentralized crypto is an attempt to wrest power of currency dilution (pernicious form of taxation) &amp; capital controls from governments.

@loshan1212 @itsALLrisky For those bad at math üëÜ, 100X higher transaction volume with 100X lower fees means total fees earned stay same. Low fees &amp; high volume are needed to become currency of Earth.
@PPathole @long_elon @itsALLrisky My understanding is that the big accounts are exchanges. Would be good to confirm though. Am told the biggest one is Robinhood.
@long_elon @itsALLrisky Only if Doge can‚Äôt do it. Big pain in the neck to create another one.
@XHNews Congratulations!! Mars is very difficult.
@itsALLrisky Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X &amp; drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.

@garyblack00 Subscription rolls out in about a month
@Dreamweaver2oh @garyblack00 I think we‚Äôre maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately.   The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD, so much more progress has been made than it would seem.
@flcnhvy @garyblack00 End of year, along with FSD, provided we get regulatory approval. Smart Summon is just a subset of FSD.
@Leo88Williams @garyblack00 Yes
@garyblack00 We had to focus on removing radar &amp; confirming safety. That release goes out next week to US production. Then a week or two to polish pure vision FSD &amp; v9 beta will release. Difference between v8 &amp; v9 is gigantic.

@leastImAlive @thesheetztweetz They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo.   Strange that they aren‚Äôt taking more action on some of the SPACs.
@thesheetztweetz FCC is fair &amp; sensible. NHTSA &amp; FAA too. 99.9% of the time, I agree with regulators!   On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn‚Äôt anticipate.

@AstroJordy I‚Äôm staying at a friend‚Äôs place in Florida that is 85% powered by Tesla Solar Roof + Powerwall.   When grid power goes down, air-conditioning automatically turns off in some of the house. Computers &amp; lights don‚Äôt even flicker. Owner says he doesn‚Äôt notice.
@28delayslater Does seem a little weird
@OwenSparks_ @AstroJordy @neuralink ü§£
@JohnnaCrider1 @WholeMarsBlog If Tesla owners are ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù, then it would be fair to call them ‚Äúadvertising salespeople masquerading as truthtellers‚Äù.   If that‚Äôs an unfair criticism, a simple rebuttal would be to show their articles per fatality for all automakers. Tesla is  ~0.02% of deaths ‚Ä¶
Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery enables consumers to be their own utility
@jack True
@ValaAfshar Very important. Most people don‚Äôt know this. Wind is also super cheap, especially when paired with batteries.
@annerajb Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous &amp; double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.  In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.
Powerwall 2 peak &amp; steady power capability is better than advertised.   Now that we have lots of operational data, Tesla can unlock higher capabilities for free via software update next month.   Depending on production date, power increase power may be &gt;50% at 30C ambient temp.
Solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall. Powerwall will interface only between utility meter &amp; house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install &amp; seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.
Starting next week, Tesla Solar Panels &amp; Solar Roof will only be sold as an integrated product *with* Tesla Powerwall battery
@wintonARK Did you buy a Powerwall? Utility permission is required for flowing electricity back to grid, but usually not if stored in our battery. This also enables 24/7 electricity security for your home.  Utility permission is still needed for when Powerwall is full &amp; can stabilize grid.

@Amart15416132 @WSJ Your research as a private individual is better than professionals @WSJ!   Data logs recovered so far show Autopilot was not enabled &amp; this car did not purchase FSD.  Moreover, standard Autopilot would require lane lines to turn on, which this street did not have.
@teslaownersSV @SpaceX @NASA @considercosmos Support for humanity‚Äôs future in space is super appreciated. Let‚Äôs make the sci-fi future we want real!
@flcnhvy ü§£ü§£
@WholeMarsBlog Passive Autopilot (sometimes called active safety) comes standard on all Teslas
@WholeMarsBlog Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half.   Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again.   Doesn‚Äôt mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.
@WhatsupFranks Great progress by Tesla team

@RationalEtienne @F9Block5 While perhaps obvious in hindsight, it turns out that the only way to solve self-driving is to solve a big part of real-world AI.

@tesla_adri @WholeMarsBlog These things are best thought of as probabilities. There are 5 forward-facing cameras. It is highly likely that at least one of them will see multiple cars ahead.
@WholeMarsBlog Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar).   Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it.   As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.
@WholeMarsBlog When radar and vision disagree, which one do you believe? Vision has much more precision, so better to double down on vision than do sensor fusion.
@WholeMarsBlog This is a major problem!
Just needs some legs
The Starship launch tower that catches the giant rocket booster is basically Mechazilla

@lexfridman @neuralink Yes
The device is implanted flush with skull &amp; charges wirelessly, so you look &amp; feel totally normal
@IheartTesla Absolutely doable. Possibly as soon as Neuralink device version 2, highly likely by version 3.
Later versions will be able to shunt signals from Neuralinks in brain to Neuralinks in body motor/sensory neuron clusters, thus enabling, for example, paraplegics to walk again
@mindofkacper @neuralink Yes

@jordanxmajel @WatchersTank @SpaceX Shock absorption is built into tower arms. Since tower is ground side, it can use a lot more mass to arrest booster downward momentum.

@IvanEscobosa Latter
To be clear, I do support vaccines in general &amp; covid vaccines specifically. The science is unequivocal.   In very rare cases, there is an allergic reaction, but this is easily addressed with an EpiPen.
@DavidWillisSLS @_Jevis_ @PPathole Needs legs for moon &amp; Mars
@SciGuySpace Global payload to orbit is the key metric
@Julius_Burton @Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @NASASpaceflight @ChrisG_NSF @thejackbeyer @FelixSchlang Nice
@_Jevis_ @PPathole Ideal scenario imo is catching Starship in horizontal ‚Äúglide‚Äù with no landing burn, although that is quite a challenge for the tower! Next best is catching with tower, with emergency pad landing mode on skirt (no legs).
@PPathole Starship booster, largest flying object ever designed, will be caught out of sky by launch tower. Big step forward, as reflight can be done in under an hour.
@WholeMarsBlog Well-written and fair, much like his articles on space

@tobyliiiiiiiiii @katlinegrey I recommend propulsive landing, as that is extensible to planets, moons &amp; asteroids. Wings &amp; runways are limited to Earth.
@PPathole @katlinegrey For practical purposes, there is no limit. It will just get increasingly difficult to service.

@jdeshetler @NASASpaceflight @SpaceX @BocaChicaGal Can be a little foggy sometimes :)
@Erdayastronaut @LabPadre Barely a scratch. :) Back on the stand soon! Will report conclusions as soon as we know them.
Starbase will grow by several thousand people over the next year or two
@OwenSparks_ I sure hope so!
@OwenSparks_ Agreed! We‚Äôre not super far, as Magic Valley Utility can give us almost all wind-power, which will be used for LOX (78% of propellant mass)/N2/argon distillation. We‚Äôre also aiming to increase solar power from 1MW to 10MW, paired with Tesla Megapacks, for continuous power.
Am donating $20M to Cameron County schools &amp; $10M to City of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. Details to follow next week.
@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX BN1 is a manufacturing pathfinder, so will be scrapped. We learned a lot, but have already changed design to BN2.   Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.
Please consider moving to Starbase or greater Brownsville/South Padre area in Texas &amp; encourage friends to do so!   SpaceX‚Äôs hiring needs for engineers, technicians, builders &amp; essential support personnel of all kinds are growing rapidly.
@CodingMark @Adamklotz_ @SpaceX More like V10.0
@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield &amp; stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.  However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating &amp; land intact.
@Adamklotz_ @SpaceX SN15 rolls to launch pad in a few days. It has hundreds of design improvements across structures, avionics/software &amp; engine.   Hopefully, one of those improvements covers this problem. If not, then retrofit will add a few more days.
@SpaceX Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent &amp; didn‚Äôt reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn‚Äôt needed.   Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.
@SpaceX At least the crater is in the right place!
@SpaceX A high production rate solves many ills
@Tesmanian_com Demand is no problem, but near-term cell supply makes it hard to scale Semi. This limitation will be less onerous next year.
@Erdayastronaut Tracking to a potential 8am liftoff
@wapodavenport That would be great, or possibly via video with full access to telemetry

@AdamSinger Haha
@SpaceXMR Heavy comes in more like a javelin. Similar to Falcon 9, but caught by the tower vs landing on legs.

@WholeMarsBlog I once did a road trip across most of US with 2 adults &amp; 5 kids in a Model S!
@arstechnica @SciGuySpace They are aiming too low.   Only rockets that are fully &amp; rapidly reusable will be competitive.   Everything else will seem like a cloth biplane in the age of jets.
@WholeMarsBlog The new Plaid S is our best car ever. Will be first production car to achieve 0-60mph in under 2 secs &amp; it has four doors &amp; seats up to 7 people.
@TheMarsSociety SpaceX is developing rockets needed to make life multiplanetary ‚Äî full &amp; rapid reusability at large scale. Even if SpaceX fails in that goal, the rockets will still be most advanced on Earth.  Starlink‚Äòs purpose is to provide Internet to the least served &amp; to pay for Mars.

@WholeMarsBlog Like @CyberpunkGame, but *with* self-driving haha
@PPathole @arstechnica @SciGuySpace If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.  A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year.   Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
@TezlaMick @arstechnica @SciGuySpace Yes
@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Falcon 9 is almost always at max capacity. When it has ‚Äúspare‚Äù performance, it flies back to land, which costs much less than using a droneship.  Our fundamental constraint is mass to orbit per unit time. Last year, SpaceX launched roughly double payload mass of rest of world.
@WholeMarsBlog @Herbert_Diess Fuel cells should be called fool sells! Such a silly choice for cars. Not great even for a rocket upper stage imo, but at least not absurd.
@PPathole I was just up there. Elevator on the other side. Floor is in, glass coming soon.
@Erdayastronaut @tobyliiiiiiiiii @NASASpaceflight Yeah, we talked about that internally. Could just have it land on a big net or bouncy castle. Lacks dignity, but would work. But, optimized landing propellant is only ~5% of dry mass, so it‚Äôs not a gamechanger.
@tobyliiiiiiiiii @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight Might just catch the ship with the launch tower, same as booster
@ashleevance Battery energy density is the key to electric aircraft. Autonomy for aircraft could have been done a long time ago. Modern airliners are very close to autonomous.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level.   Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.
@Astro_Soichi ‚ô•Ô∏è üáØüáµ
@NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid.   Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.
@austinbarnard45 SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank. Impact of 10m/s crushed legs &amp; part of skirt. Multiple fixes in work for SN11.
@eurotechjunkie @Alpsoy66 @WholeMarsBlog We will ask the regulators
@WholeMarsBlog Build 8.3 of FSD should be done QA testing by end of next week, so that‚Äôs roughly when download button should show up

@engineers_feed Ultimately, yes
@garyblack00 Update probably in Q2. Cybertruck will be built at Giga Texas, so focus right now is on getting that beast built.
@westcoastbill The $1400 is mostly good imo (UBI lite), as the people get to choose how the money is spent, but the rest is mostly net bad for the people as a whole (though it is obviously characterized otherwise).
@arctechinc Should be very soon. Many subtle differences between US &amp; Canada roads, so harder than it seems.
@LarryKellogg @arctechinc The Tesla FSD computer started shipping in volume in Q2 2019. 2020 cars should all have FSD computers, whether or not  ordered as an option.
Availability varies by region due to regulatory approval delays and/or Tesla internal development &amp; testing.   Note: word ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù is used to reduce complacency in usage &amp; set expectations appropriately. All software is first tested internally by Tesla simulation &amp; QA drive teams.
Doge spelled backwards is Egod

If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know. Doubling beta program size now with 8.2 &amp; probably 10X size with 8.3. Still be careful, but it‚Äôs getting mature.
@chicago_glenn @TimSweeneyEpic @TrevorMahlmann Starhopper is an old timer who has seen a lot of things!
@TimSweeneyEpic Thrust was low despite being commanded high for reasons unknown at present, hence hard touchdown. We‚Äôve never seen this before.  Next time, min two engines all the way to the ground &amp; restart engine 3 if engine 1 or 2 have issues.

@eugenelee3 @SpaceXFan97 Most of Earth by end of year, all by next year, then it‚Äôs about densifying coverage.   Important to note that cellular will always have the advantage in dense urban areas.   Satellites are best for low to medium population density areas.

@PeterSchiff An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.  Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.  That data, like all data, is subject to latency &amp; error. The system will evolve to that which minimizes both.

@realfuckingnews @business Somehow, a hash text file using ancient crypto can be exchanged for real goods &amp; services!? Amazing.
@business To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don‚Äôt even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla.   However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn‚Äôt look elsewhere.   Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money. The key word is ‚Äúalmost‚Äù.
@business Tesla‚Äôs action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&amp;P500 company.
@Teslarati SpaceX in south Texas &amp; Tesla in central have been providing direct assistance where feasible (eg save cold turtles &amp; help power the water treatment plant). Please let us know if we may be helpful in other ways.

@BLKMDL3 @RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Once we can predict cash flow reasonably well, Starlink will IPO
@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ Starlink is a staggeringly difficult technical &amp; economic endeavor. However, if we don‚Äôt fail, the cost to end users will improve every year.
@RationalEtienne @Adamklotz_ SpaceX needs to pass through a deep chasm of negative cash flow over the next year or so to make Starlink financially viable. Every new satellite constellation in history has gone bankrupt. We hope to be the first that does not.
@ID_AA_Carmack Lowest cost per ton of carbon sequestered, net of value of any product made.   Must be scalable to gigaton level.  Aiming for maximum usefulness.
@Adamklotz_ It‚Äôs meant to be the same price in all countries. Only difference should be taxes &amp; shipping.

@itsALLrisky Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.  Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster.

@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX That said, the ship landing burn has a clear solution. My greatest concern is achieving good payload to orbit with rapid &amp; full reusability, without which we shall forever be confined to Earth.
@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Will still use hot gas maneuvering (RCS) thrusters, as ~5X more efficient than nitrogen (300 sec vs 60 sec Isp)
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Higher Isp too
@Erdayastronaut @josh_bickett @ajtourville @SpaceX Intuitively, it would seem so, but turbopump-fed Raptors have much higher thrust &amp; propellant mass fraction than pressure-fed gas thrusters &amp; they‚Äôre already there
@brendan2908 @NASASpaceflight Yes
@mikko @Darudevil It‚Äôs true!
@josh_bickett @ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yeah. By default, engine with least lever arm would shut down if all 3 are good.
@ajtourville @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky
@Adamklotz_ @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX It was foolish of us not to start 3 engines &amp; immediately shut down 1, as 2 are needed to land

On Clubhouse tonight at 10pm LA time
@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially. That came from me reading about Soviet methane engine tests that got over 380 Isp. At that Isp, a subcooled methane stage gets slightly better delta-V than a hydrogen stage.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor
@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.
@we5dogg @teslaownersSV No escaping that for me

@NASASpaceflight Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure.   Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.

@WholeMarsBlog The entire ‚Äústack‚Äù from data collection through labeling &amp; inference has to be in surround video. This is a hard problem. Critically, however, this does not require a hardware change to cars in field.
@flcnhvy @WholeMarsBlog Yes, although it will be crazy not to turn  on FSD
@WholeMarsBlog Tesla is steadily moving all NNs to 8 camera surround video. This will enable superhuman self-driving.

@arstechnica @SciGuySpace Given so many other companies are depending on this mission, it is getting even more scrutiny than a Starlink flight
@GerberKawasaki They are part of the solution, but require lots of fresh water &amp; land. We may need something that‚Äôs ultra-large- scale industrial in 10 to 20 years. For now, by far the top priority is accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy economy.

@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Was also thinking that SpaceX Boca should hold fun parties and give tours for the community from time to time
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX I super support public spaces around our production &amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely. When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.

@techreview And increase fun! Hopefully.
@benmezrich Me neither
@TonyChoMrMagic @TeslaEnergy One of the best Tesla Solar Roof installations
@91demigod No, but maybe one day
@PPathole @engineers_feed Yes, that would be the best way to do it. A large solar field or reactor is needed for power, and then some ice mining droids or long maneuvering drills are needed for the H2O. These are probably the trickier bits.
@flcnhvy Probably less than a few dozen primary decision-makers. Technically, only three.
@Erdayastronaut @lexfridman Or at least the option for verification, so that the public can ascribe more credibility to verified vs unverified accounts
Btw, critical feedback is always super appreciated, as well as ways to donate money that really make a difference (way harder than it seems)
@eugenelee3 @engineers_feed Yup
@engineers_feed Indirectly, an electric rocket is possible by using electricity to convert CO2+H2O ‚Äî&gt; CH4+O2. This will be needed on Mars even for early missions &amp; Earth too over time.
@engineers_feed Not to get to orbit, unfortunately. In space, photon emission powered by matter-antimatter annihilation would rock, but that‚Äôs more of a long-term solution.
@Teslarati @ResidentSponge This will be hard to make, as it isn‚Äôt like any other vehicle
